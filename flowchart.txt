1. importing the packages
2. exploring the dataset - Crytocurrency (Bitcoin) Data 
3. data processing & Data Cleaning
4. visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Splitting the data to train and test
6. building the model
    - LSTM
    - LSTM + CPD
    - Linear Regression
    - Lasso Regression
    - Ridge Regression
    - XGBooster Regression
    - Voting Regression
    - MLP
    - RNN
    - CNN
    - Attention + CPD + LSTM
   
7. training the model
8. building the model with LSTM gives better accuracy comparing with Other Models
9. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. importing the packages
11. User gives input as Symbol of crytocurrencty
12. the given input is preprocessed and the data regarding cryto is
scraped based yahoo finance 
13. then based on the input cryto the tweets are scraped  using tweepy
14. with all this informtion, the define LSTM model and ARIMA is used for prediction
15. final outcome is displayed through frontend

Note:

Extension - CNN, RNN, MLP, and Machine Learning model and ARIMA is used with proposed one 
from which LSTM gives better accuracy and from that LSTM is used to build the ,
model and save it from user prediction
